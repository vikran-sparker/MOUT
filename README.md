MESS ON UR TIPS
------------------------------

TONNES OF KG OF FOOD IS DISCARDED AT SEVERAL COLLEGE CAMPUSES EVERY DAY. MOST OF THEM GOES TO LAND FILLS. MANY STUDENTS ARE NEITHER CONSCIOUS OF THE VOLUME OF WASTE THEY ACCUMULATE EVERY DAY IN THEIR COLLEGE MESS. FAILURE TO SUSTAINABLY DISPOSE OF FOOD WASTE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT SO HERE WE HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO COPE UP WITH THIS PROBLEM AND WASTAGE OF FOOD:

PROPOSAL: Students marking themselves absent for the meals that they are not going to attend. For this the requirement is a platform where students can register themselves by using their registration IDs. The app will consist of menu and would also provide details of the upcoming food material i.e. breakfast, lunch or dinner.
They would be provided an option for choosing if they are interested in having the upcoming mess food or not. The response needs to be submitted 5 hours before of the mess cooking time. If they choose “YES”, then a QR code would be generated which needs to be scanned at the mess entrance for verification.
